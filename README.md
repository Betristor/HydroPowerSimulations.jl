# HydroPowerSimulations.jl

This package contains extensions on [PowerSystems.jl](https://github.com/nrel-siip/powersystems.jl) and [PowerSimulations.jl](https://github.com/nrel-siip/powersimulations.jl) to enable enhanced hydropower representations. Extensions on the basic hydropower representations include:

 - Cascading hydropower network representation with `HydroEnergyCascade` device and `HydroDispatchReservoirCascade` formulation.
